# Work Examples

Hello! I’m Eron, an education consultant turned documentation engineer (aka a software engineer that creates content). Here are a few hand-picked samples of my work, selected to align well with the Job Description.

## Education & LMS
This is [one my Udemy courses](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-english-faster-how-to-make-a-plan/?referralCode=4E68EE654F252BD53D56). Over 15,000 students have completed it  with ~10,000 actively enrolled. I’ve also produced ~15 other training courses and certification programs in China for blackboard, however the content is not accessible without enrollment in the relevant institutions. This course is managed on Udemy, which provides an LMS for content creators. I can use no-code LMSs or configure and deploy Open Source LMSs for enterprise use.

## HTML5 / CSS
This is the [Directus documentation platform](https://docs.directus.io/). Directus is an open source project with over ~25,000 GitHub stars, making it a top 1,000 GitHub repo. I built this documentation platform and authored hundreds of pages of content. Technical content is written in Markdown, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Vue.js

## UX Research
Here’s an example of [public-facing forum as UX research](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/16597), for a content format I developed, called a “recipe”. Recipes demonstrate production-ready development solutions as bite-size lessons, targeted at software engineers. Most UX research is conducted ethereally, through forms and zoom calls. However, I like to have it as a forum discussion as well. This way, many stakeholders can cross-share their ideas.  

## Content
Here is a [GitHub repo for blog post I wrote in markdown](https://github.com/freetalk-fun/devtalk/blob/master/docs/notebook/ts/basic-types.md), to demonstrate I can use markdown, JS/TS, GitHub, etc.

Here is [a piece UX / educational content I’m personally proud of](https://docs.directus.io/app/data-model.html). Relational data models are super simple, but very poorly explained. This article does an excellent job of explaining Data Models in a way that completely non-technical users can easily understand and learn from.

# Summary
If there’s anything else specific you’d like to see, please feel free to reach out!

I'm happy to provide:
